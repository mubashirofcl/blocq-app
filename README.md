## 📖 About the Project

**Blocq** is a modern, responsive, and fully functional blogging application.  
Anyone can browse and read blogs freely. Authenticated users (via Google Sign-In) gain full control over their own posts — including creating, editing, and deleting.

The app uses **Firebase Firestore** as a real-time database, **Firebase Authentication** for secure login, and **React + Tailwind CSS** for a clean and dynamic UI.
